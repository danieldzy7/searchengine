Installation Instructions:

Our project requires the following packages to be installed:
 - bottle
 - numpy
 - Beautiful Soup 3
 - SQLite version 3.6.12
 - python 2.6.1

To set up a database, simply run crawler.py with python and it will overwrite the previous database with the current URL list. You can change the contents of the URL list in urls.txt.

To run the server, simply run server.py with python and it will host the web server at localhost:8080. Type the input in the box just as in a search engine  and hit enter or submit. You will be redirected to a new page with the URL list. 

Comments:
Be sure to run the server after crawler has finished running.

Project Description:

Name: Searched Engine Project

Summary:
The challenge of the CSC326 project is to create a website that mimic's Google search engine. Given a keyword query from the web user, the frontend is able to search through an indexed database and to return a list of related URLs. These URLs are sorted in order according to the pagerank of the website and its relation to the keyword. The backend is responsible for building the indexed database for the front end to use. It recursively searches through URLs, parses and returns a word count for site it visits. In addition, the backend will calculate a pagerank for each of these sites.
